# Roger-workprofile

This is my current portfolio listing my experience as a software engineer displaying
my deployed projects that i have done up to this point of my career. I realize that I am starting and will fill in 
more deployed projects showing my development and experience as a serious software
engineer and a candidate for employment in your organization.
I set up my portfolio with three navigating sections, about me, my work, and contact me. 
Each section, when clicked should go to that section showing the respective areas that are called for viewing.
I will fill in more deployments as I go through the course to make a fuller portfolio that will catch what the employer is asking for in the job description. 
At the bottom I have a contact me secton where the employer can contact me for questions or possible employment opportunities.
